# chef-init
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/opscode/chef-init.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/opscode/chef-init)

chef-init is a RubyGem that is distributed with [chef-container] and intended to be used as PID1 inside Linux Containers.

Its primary purpose is to provide an interface with which to safely launch a chef-client run and a process supervisor to manage the services that your Chef recipes create.

Its secondary purpose is to provide useful Chef Resources and Recipe DSLs that you can use to interface more cleanly with the process supervisor.

## Installation
This RubyGem is already bundled with [chef-container](http://github.com/opscode/chef-container) and should not be install separately.

## Usage
Check out the documentation [here](http://docs.opscode.com/containers.html)
